I am interested in understanding the nature of galaxy clusters, the most massive objects you can find in the Universe. I am also interested in using galaxy clusters to probe the nature of the Universe, especially the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. I use computational and analytical approaches to model galaxy clusters, and extract physical insights by comparing the model predictions with observations.
